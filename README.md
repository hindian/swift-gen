It is a set of interfaces developed to build application in java rapidly. It consists of layers which are loosely coupled  but it is very simple in architecture. Instead of fixed hard coded user interfaces and interaction with backend it supports pluggability, i.e. at each layer you enjoy flexibility and you can use any pluggable implementation other than default implementation.

=====
=====
hIndian is a standard to build library for enterprise application. It utilizes the power of java programming language and is a layered architecture

Mission
=======
1. To simplify the programming task, while maintaining coding style of java
2. To reduce the size of code through self code generation mechanism for trivial tasks.
3. To Develop an intelligent framework which is light also.

Description
===========
HIndian is an open source project to accelerate application development on java platform. It utilizes simplicity and power of java, but reduces the overhead of configuration and size of code. Conventions and annotations are preferred over configurations to deploy and manage an application. 

This framework, light in nature, usually implements functionalities of ‘hindian-core’ interfaces. ‘hindian-core’ itself consists of few interfaces and annotations. We have provided default implementations of all interfaces and you may feel free to create your own library which either extends our default implementations or implements the core interfaces. 

Despite our best efforts to make it simple and bugs free, it may have some overheads and issues. Its ingenuity and performance can be improved, if you actively participate in this project, report bugs, and post suggestions.
